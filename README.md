# Data Structures Project
This is a Data Structures project. The main objective is to create and use a stack structure in practice.
<br>The code is computing and returning <em>TRUE</em> or <em>FALSE</em> based on user input. The user is requested to enter
the number of inputs and then enter a character one after other. Accepted and stored characters are '(,),{,}'. The program computes if the array is balanced or not
by using <strong>array implementation of stack structure</strong>. Note that <em>({})</em> is a balanced input and <em>(}{)</em> is not.
<br><em>Exampales for balanced array: (){} , ({}) , {}(){}, (){()}</em>
<br><em>Examples for unbalanced array: ({) , {}) , (()} , {}{()</em>
